###Install and Build

```bash
- npm install
```
```bash
- bower install
```

### Grunt Build task

To build the app (create the '/build' folder with content) you need to run the following command:

```bash
grunt build
```

###Grunt "Serve" Task

To serve the project (accessing it through http://localhost:8080 to test it)
```bash
grunt
```

Note: the `/build` folder is not going to be generated or updated. After work with this server, you need to run `grunt build` manually to update the `/build` folder with the latest changes.
